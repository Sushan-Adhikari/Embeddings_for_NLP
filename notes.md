# AI/ML Text Processing Notes

## Introduction
This is the beginning of the notes.

## Goals
- Understand the challenges of converting unstructured text into numerical data for AI/ML
- Store vectors effectively

## Agenda
1. Turn text to numbers
2. Improving the representations
3. Storing Embeddings

## Part 1: Turning Text into Numbers

### Why Convert Text to Numbers?
Text-to-number conversion enables:
- Feeding data to ML/DL models
- Information retrieval
- Document summarization
- Language translation
- Content recommendation
- Sentiment analysis
- Question answering systems

### Data Representation Objectives
- Obtain a unified semantic space
- Create a single representation that works with all types of words
- Ensure practical usability of the representations

## Key Concepts

### Text Vectorization Methods
| Method | Description | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Bag-of-Words | Count-based word representation | Basic text classification |
| TF-IDF | Frequency-inverse document frequency | Information retrieval |
| Word2Vec | Neural word embeddings | Semantic analysis |
| BERT | Contextual embeddings | Advanced NLP tasks |

### Challenges in Text Representation
1. **Dimensionality**: High-dimensional sparse vectors
2. **Semantics**: Capturing word meanings and relationships
3. **Context**: Handling polysemy (multiple meanings)
4. **Scalability**: Processing large text corpora
